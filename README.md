Repository: 
A repository is a digital storage space which enables me to save work work in the lab and allows me to access the data from a different location without haveing to take a phisical copy of the doctuments with me. 

The contents of this repository contains my first work using linux and Github, so contains files which describe the basics of using linux and githuib as I progress through the labs set for the week begining of 25/09/17
