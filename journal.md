Lab 1:



Markdown is a way to write code using plain text which can then be formatted into XHTML/HTML. The syntax is is comprised of exclusivly punctuation. 

Block quotes: These are used to make the text wrap when the text becomes too long. This then creates a new paragraph. 
Line Breaks: This is the same as Block quotes but creates a new line on the same paragraph, rather than creating a new paragraph. 

Linux

..Command Lines: 
..$Ls                                          // Lists directory contents//
..$cd/temp                                    // Moves to the temp directory
..$cd $Home                                  // Takes you to the user dircetory
..$mkdir                                    // Creates Directories
..$echo "Hello" > hello.md                 // Echo Display Line of Text
..$cat hello.md                           // Print Standard Output
..$cp hello.md hello-again.md            // Copies Files/directories
..$mv hello-again.md                    // Move Files/Rename
..$rm hello.md                         // Remove files/directories
..$ rm-rf                             // Bad things... Ver Bad Things... 
..$cat/proc/cpuinfo                  // Display CPU Information




..I have now learnt how to create directories and how to add files into those directories. I have also learnt how to upload files to ..Github and what git hub is (An online directory). In addition i have also learnt some simple lines of code to use in the Linux ..Terminal which allows me to complete some tasks without using the user interface. 






Lab 2: 

Building a DC Motor: 

In Lab 2 we have started to build a basic DC Motor which comprises of a 145 turns of copper wire wrapped around a standard sized bottle cork. At one of the ends of the cork there is two pieces of copper tape attached. Theses two pieces of copper take act as a commutator. The commutator then has one end of the copper wire that is wrapped around the cork soldered onto it (one end of each half of of the commutator). We then placed two wires attached to a power supply providing 10v's just touching the commutator (these were later replaced with a wire which provided a better serface to create a bruch with). After this we then added two sets of opposing magnets either side of the cork, whcih once the power was turned on would drive the motor to spin. Before the next Lab we hope to add another coil of wire to our design which will create a more stable motor.
