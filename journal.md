In addition i have also learnt some simple lines of code to use in the Linux Terminal whihc allows me to complete some tasks without using the user interface. 






Lab 2: 

Building a DC Motor: 

In Lab 2 we have started to build a basic DC Motor which comprises of a 145 turns of copper wire wrapped around a standard sized bottle cork. At one of the ends of the cork there is two pieces of copper tape attached. Theses two pieces of copper take act as a commutator. The commutator then has one end of the copper wire that is wrapped around the cork soldered onto it (one end of each half of of the commutator). We then placed two wires attached to a power supply providing 10v's just touching the commutator (these were later replaced with a wire which provided a better serface to create a bruch with). After this we then add two sets of opposing magnets either side of the cork whcih once the powere was turned on would drive the motor to spin.
